      aboutMe: [
        `Hello, I'm Natalia. As a C# developer I used to spend a lot of time developing desktop applications, and my favorite part
        was creating smart and functional user interfaces with Win Forms. During the parental leave I decided to completely change my specialisation
        and dive into absolutely new for me exciting world of front-end web development. Thus I've been taking courses and do my best to obtain best practices
        of the modern fron-end development. It turned out to be more difficult than I expected
        (much more difficult, actually :), but I'm enthusiastic about developing and improving this skills. I'm responsible, open-minded and friendly,
        and I truly like to gain knowleage.`,
        `I am from Moscow, Russia. In August 2018 I relocated to Brno, Czech Republic with my family. I'm learning Czech language with great interest,
        my current language level is B1.`,
        `In my spare time I do something from the list below or just to relax with my family.`,
