        `Hello, I'm Natalia. I used to spend a lot of time developing desktop applications, and my favorit part was
        creating smart and functional user interfaces. Thus I desided to dive into absolutely new for me and very exiting
        front-end web development. It turn out to be more difficult than I expected (much more difficult, actually :), but
        I like it and want to learn new things and practices.`,
